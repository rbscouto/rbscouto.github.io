<p> Hi! I'm a maths PhD student at the University of Porto and at the University of St Andrews (co-tutelle) working under joint supervision of Ana Cristina Freitas, Jorge Freitas and Mike Todd. The co-tutelle agreement means that the PhD work in my 4 year PhD program takes place at the University of Porto in years 1 and 4 and at the University of St Andrews in years 2 and 3. I'm currently in year 3.</p>
  
<p> Before starting my PhD I completed undergraduate and MSc studies in mathematics, both at the University of Porto.</p>
  
<p> I'm broadly interested in dynamical systems and probability. My PhD project focuses on the (statistical) study of chaotic systems using machinery from extreme value theory.</p>

<p> Outside of maths, I'm very passionate about sports and I may show up as a volleyball player (competitive amateur level). I also deeply enjoy travelling and standing in the sun.</p>
