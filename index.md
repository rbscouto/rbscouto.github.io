<p> Hi! I'm a Maths PhD student at the University of Porto and at the University of St Andrews (co-tutelle) working under the supervision of Ana Cristina Freitas, Jorge Freitas and Mike Todd. Before starting my PhD, I completed undergraduate and MSc studies in Mathematics, both at the University of Porto.</p>
  
<p> Mathematically, I'm broadly interested in Dynamical Systems and Probability. My PhD project focuses on the employment of extreme value theory (for dynamical systems) in the study of chaotic systems.</p>
