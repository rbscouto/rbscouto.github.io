<p> Hi! I'm a maths PhD student at the University of Porto and at the University of St Andrews (co-tutelle) working under the supervision of Ana Cristina Freitas, Jorge Freitas and Mike Todd. Before starting my PhD, I completed undergraduate and MSc studies in mathematics, both at the University of Porto.</p>
  
<p> I'm broadly interested in dynamical systems and probability. My PhD project focuses on the employment of extreme value theory (for dynamical systems) in the study of chaotic systems.</p>

<p> Outside of maths, I'm very passionate about sports and I may show up as a volleyball player (amateur competitive level). I also deeply enjoy travelling and standing in the sun.</p>
