<p> Hi! I'm a maths PhD student at the University of Porto (<a href="https://www.cmup.pt">CMUP</a>) and at the University of St Andrews (<a href="http://www-maths.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/pg/pure/Analysis/index.html">Analysis Group</a>) in a co-tutelle program, working under the joint supervision of <a href="https://www.fep.up.pt/docentes/amoreira/">Ana Cristina Freitas</a>, <a href="https://www.fc.up.pt/pessoas/jmfreita/">Jorge Freitas</a> and <a href="http://www.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~miket/">Mike Todd</a>. My PhD is fully funded by FCT - Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia. The co-tutelle implies that the PhD work corresponding to a 4 year program takes place at the University of Porto in years 1 and 4 and at the University of St Andrews in years 2 and 3. I'm currently in year 4.</p>
  
<p> Before starting my PhD I completed undergraduate and MSc studies in mathematics, both at the University of Porto.</p>
  
<p> I'm broadly interested in dynamical systems and probability. My PhD project focuses on the (statistical) study of chaotic systems using machinery from the theory of dynamical extremes.</p>

<p> Outside of maths, I'm very passionate about sports and I may show up as a volleyball player (competitive amateur level). I also deeply enjoy travelling and standing in the sun.</p>
