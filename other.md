<h3> iNIGMA </h3>

<p> In 2016, I integrated iNIGMA: a group of undergraduate and MSc students in maths (at the University of Porto) who met informally to discuss interesting problems and support colleagues who where struggling with contents from the undergraduate modules.</p>

<p> In 2017, we founded iNIGMA - Núcleo de Estudantes de Matemática da Universidade do Porto, which gave iNIGMA the legal status of a Students' Union. I was in the first board as vice-president. We took off with the coordination of several small events such as talks, workshops and tournaments.</p>

<p> In 2018, iNIGMA organised "Jornadas de Matemática da Universidade do Porto", a 3 day event aimed at students from Porto whose program consisted of mathematical communications, contact with external employers and a social component.

<p> In 2019, iNIGMA organised "ENEMath 19 - Encontro Nacional de Estudantes de Matemática", a 4 day event aimed at students from Portugal whose program consisted of mathematical communications, contact with external employers and a social component. Highlights <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVoqHy1H4rA">video</a>.</p>

 <p> Until I finished my MSc in Mathematics in 2019, I kept on iNIGMA's board as vice-president (re-elected).</p>
