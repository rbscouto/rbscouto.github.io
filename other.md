Miscellaneous of mathematical and non-mathematical subjects.

<h3> iNIGMA </h3>

<p> In 2016, I integrated iNIGMA, a group of undergraduate and MSc students in Mathematics who met informally to discuss interesting problems and support colleagues who struggled with contents from the undergraduate courses.</p>

<p> In 2017, we founded iNIGMA - Núcleo de Estudantes de Matemática da Universidade do Porto, which gave iNIGMA the legal status of a Students' Union. I was in the first board as vice-president.</p>

<p> In 2018, iNIGMA organised "Jornadas de Matemática da Universidade do Porto", a 3 day event aimed at students from Porto whose program consisted of mathematical communications, contact with external employers and a social component. Highlights video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AB3b_Np7c0A&t=5s">here</a>.</p>

<p> In 2019, iNIGMA organised "ENEMath 19 - Encontro Nacional de Estudantes de Matemática", a 4 day event aimed at students from Portugal whose program consisted of mathematical communications, contact with external employers and a social component. Highlights video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVoqHy1H4rA">here</a>.</p>

 <p> Until I finished my MSc in Mathematics in 2019, I kept being on iNIGMA's board as vice-president.</p>
