<h3> iNIGMA </h3>

<p> In 2016 I integrated iNIGMA, a group of undergraduate and MSc students in Mathematics who met informally to discuss interesting problems or support colleagues.</p>

<p> In 2017 we founded iNIGMA - Núcleo de Estudantes de Matemática da Universidade do Porto, which gave iNIGMA the legal status of a Students' Union.</p>
